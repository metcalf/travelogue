# Travelogue

Written: Summer 2009

Travelogue is a travel journal application that display journal entries and photos on a map
and timeline.  I wrote it to display my trip journal from a 6+ week trip in South America and
the Caribbean.  It is a Rails app that uses the timemap javascript library to synchronize a SIMILE
timeline with a Google map.
